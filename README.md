#Young's double slit experiment

The three-body problem is a classic mechanics problem that looks at how three different objects would move over time only under the influence of each other's gravity. 

Unlike the two-body problem, which has a general analytical solution, the three-body problem does not have a general solution. Only certain [special-case solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem#/media/File:5_4_800_36_downscaled.gif) have been found.

I was inspired to try and make a model after reading Liu Cixin's three-body problem series.
