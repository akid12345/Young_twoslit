#Young's double slit experiment

Young's double-slit experiment, conducted by Thomas Young in 1801, demonstrated the wave nature of light. It showed that when light passed through two small slits, it created an interference pattern on a screen behind them, characterized by alternating bright (constructive interference) and dark (destructive interference) fringes. The pattern, resulting from the superposition of light waves, provived strong evidence that light was a wave, and not a series of particles.
